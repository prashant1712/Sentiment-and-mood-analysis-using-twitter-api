Never have I ever hated a mascara more than @COVERGIRL 's bombshell volume. It makes my lashes stick to each other &amp; I can't ever get it off
Of course the moment I grill everyone's burgers, I run out of propane and can't grill mine.
Why is my grill out of propane  I want grilled chicken
Does anybody know where to get Oreo Cookie Dough I couldn't find any at Target
@luvbeatrice177 What, Oscar Meyer pizza lunchables? Yeah the crust breading is different. Just not the same delicious taste anymore.
Went out to go grill the Christmas Steaks and the hose from the propane to the grill has a leak. It's a Christmas Travesty.
If you want to sell Obamacare, put in on a shelf at Walmart, or Amazon, or an auction on Ebay @MikeintheCouv @cbielem
Odds Ted Cruz & conservatives can stop Obamacare is slim. More than Dems the Repubs who do not stand will pay price in 2014 primaries.
Just for the record, cookie dough flavored Oreo cookies. Do not fucking eat them! They taste like spackle on chocolate!

Hey, @COVERGIRL I'm having as hard time removing the #bombshell volume by #lashblast mascara. What do you recommend to remove?
we all agreed NOT to discuss Obamacare because we wanted to be THANKFUL for each other and not remember we all can’t afford Obama care
Does the #HaagenDazs Gelato commercial strike anyone else as kind of offensive? Maybe I'm over thinking it.
purposefully skipped the snacks aisle at walmart today so I wouldn't be tempted to buy the cookie dough oreos
My 11yr old sister told me I needed to shave my armpits. So there's that.

I wish Haagen Dazs would stop making gelato flavors. I thought I had seen all of the commercials, but I was wrong. I was WRONG.
Bought a new gas grill @BigLots   Every box and bag inside open and pieces missing. How does that happen?

BEYOND furious that these steaks were supposed to taste amazing until I learned that our shitty apartment didn't put gas in the grill
@ZacCoffman @MikeBeas @Oreo The Cookie Dough oreo’s were so disappointing. Way to much of a coffee taste. Marshmallow Crispy is great though
lol Just got some pizza lunchables....and I swear they looked a lot bigger when I was a kid.
pasta is cheap. salt is cheap. boiling water is cheap (at least in the US). never buying #barilla pasta again is priceless. #LGBT
I want the world to know NOT to buy Bombshell mascara by @COVERGIRL so you don't have to suffer like my poor eyelashes have. Refund. Please.
That REV wrap commercial is bullshit. A swimmer can't survive practice running on tortilla wrap, a slice of ham and cheese
You guys, when smoking with wood chips on a gas grill you really need to soak them. They will start a fire. #ProTip
@SwensonBrett trying to figure out why my grill ran out of propane mid-pork chop...
There is nothing more disappointing than going to buy chicken, season it, and go to grill on a grill that suddenly has no propane tank.
i bought that nair spay clay roll on wax stuff omfg i waxed my legs and i cried for like two hours it hurt so fuckin bad
why does hair removal cream smell like egg #thoughtsfromthelibrary

Pork baby back ribs are bad to grill over a gas grill...... Damn you fat!
The Chicken and Waffles Lays do NOT taste like chicken and waffles
Just saw a billboard that read solely "Obamacare sucks!"
@Tesco just spent £10 on bucket BBQ, £5 on charcoal and more on fire lighters and now petrol and still no joy, so grill on...not happy :(
Obamacare forces Americans to purchase a product that they did not choose and can't afford under threat of the IRS.
@COVERGIRL your bombshell mascara is SHIT

That horrible moment when Wal-Mart is out of cookie dough Oreo's! :(
@JustinMBraun I had a @Charbroil grill that was half charcoal half gas likes it but it rusted in 2 years now back to @WeberGrills charcoal.
@andrewteman @universalhub @SomervilleCity so which is worse nowadays.. another bank branch or another walgreens/cvs/rite-aid?
Because i wouldn't sell my car to charcoal grill for cheap.. It would appear that i no longer get discount..
All I have to say about the whole "Affordable Care Act" debacle is that I'm glad I have my own health insurance through my employer.

I just used that hair removal crap called "Veet" and my legs are sooooo smooth, me like. This smell is DISGUSTING though!!! :/
Had some nice marinated pork chops ready to grill, then realized the grill was out of propane.  Bummer.
You know, I am a bit sad that I cannot find cookie dough oreo's.
This Hagen Daz gelato commercial disturbs me.... #gelatogasm
@Oreo #gotmyoreo received the cookie dough flavor, glad they were free.  Taste like coffee, not cookie dough.  Thanks for the sample though.

YEARS of drug store loyalty: I'm switching to @CVS_Extra because of #cvsquits - FYI @Walgreens @riteaid no disrespect but I gotta do it.
Of course the moment I grill everyone's burgers, I run out of propane and can't grill mine.
I hate shaving my legs so much that  1) I'm using veet &amp; 2) I'm doing it 4 days in advance
FACT: Nature Valley granola bars have 2x more sugar than protein + fiber combined!
@LisaLuscious The smell of Italian men's leg hair remover us worse. Super strength Veet. Lasts for days. Ugh.

If you smell gas while cooking on a propane grill, immediately get away from the grill &amp; call the fire dept. Do not move the grill.
Chicken and waffle lays do NOT taste like chicken and waffles
Spent the day cooking and cleaning the kitchen and my room... face mask, watching crappy tv and venting. Just need to put clothes away.
I remember once I went to grill some bacon, left the gas on then stuck my head under to see why it wasn't working and burnt my eyebrows off

As a woman, should I be this upset that I ran out of propane for the grill and can't find the charcoal, (which I think is gone, too)...?
@smashpro1 Shame on you. It's a combo. Left half is charcoal. Middle is propane. Right is a 3rd burner. I'd never buy a full propane grill.
do you remember when we burned that whole bag of chicken and waffles lays because they tasted like shit? #goodtimes
Quick grilling poll: what charcoal do you prefer? I switched from Kingsford to Royal Oak and find the latter vastly superior.
If your paycheck is less and health insurance cost are up please ask @SenMarkPryor and @MikeRossUpdates  why they forced Obamacare on AR.
